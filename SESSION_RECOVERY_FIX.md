# Stagehand Session Connection Fix - ROOT CAUSE RESOLVED

## Problem Analysis

The error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'send'` was occurring because:

1. **Event Loop Fragmentation**: Each Stagehand operation was running in a different event loop due to thread executor usage
2. **Session Context Loss**: Stagehand sessions are tied to specific event loops, so different event loops broke the connection
3. **Multiple Session Creation**: This caused multiple Browserbase sessions to be created instead of reusing one session

## Root Cause Identified

The fundamental issue was in the `run_async_safely()` function:
- Using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` with `asyncio.run()` created a **new event loop for each operation**
- Stagehand sessions are **bound to the event loop** where they were created
- When operations ran in different event loops, the session connection was lost
- This manifested as `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'send'` errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Persistent Event Loop Architecture

Created a dedicated, persistent event loop for all Stagehand operations:

```python
# Global persistent event loop for Stagehand operations
_stagehand_loop = None
_stagehand_thread = None

def _get_persistent_loop():
    """Get or create a persistent event loop for Stagehand operations."""
    global _stagehand_loop, _stagehand_thread
    import threading

    if _stagehand_loop is None or _stagehand_loop.is_closed():
        def create_loop():
            global _stagehand_loop
            _stagehand_loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
            asyncio.set_event_loop(_stagehand_loop)
            _stagehand_loop.run_forever()

        _stagehand_thread = threading.Thread(target=create_loop, daemon=True)
        _stagehand_thread.start()

        # Wait for loop to be ready
        import time
        while _stagehand_loop is None:
            time.sleep(0.01)

    return _stagehand_loop
```

### 2. Consistent Event Loop Usage

All Stagehand operations now use the same persistent event loop:

```python
def run_async_safely(coro):
    """
    Run async operations in a persistent event loop to maintain session context.
    This fixes the root cause by ensuring all Stagehand operations use the same event loop.
    """
    loop = _get_persistent_loop()

    # Submit the coroutine to the persistent loop
    future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
    return future.result()
```

### 3. Session Context Preservation

- **Single Event Loop**: All operations run in the same dedicated event loop thread
- **Session Binding**: Stagehand session remains bound to the persistent event loop
- **Connection Stability**: No more event loop switching that breaks connections
- **Resource Efficiency**: Only one Browserbase session is created and reused

## Key Benefits

1. **Root Cause Resolution**: Fixed the fundamental event loop fragmentation issue
2. **Session Stability**: Stagehand sessions remain connected across all operations
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Only one Browserbase session is created and reused
4. **No More Connection Errors**: Eliminates `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'send'` errors
5. **Transparent Operation**: No changes needed in agent code - fix is completely internal

## Testing Results

✅ **Session Stability Test: PASSED**
- Navigation works reliably
- Multiple extract operations succeed
- Observe operations work correctly
- Session remains stable across operations
- No connection errors occurred

## Validation

Run the test script to validate the fix:

```bash
python test_session_connection.py
```

Expected results:
- ✅ All operations complete successfully
- ✅ No `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'send'` errors
- ✅ Single Browserbase session used throughout
- ✅ Session connection remains stable

## Technical Details

**Before the Fix:**
- Each operation: New thread → New event loop → Lost session connection
- Result: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'send'` errors

**After the Fix:**
- All operations: Same persistent event loop → Maintained session connection
- Result: Stable, reliable Stagehand operations

## Usage Notes

- The fix is completely transparent - no code changes needed in agents
- All existing functionality works exactly the same
- Performance is improved due to session reuse
- Browserbase dashboard will show only one session instead of multiple
- The persistent event loop is automatically managed and cleaned up
