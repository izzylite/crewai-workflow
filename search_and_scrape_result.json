However, here is a suggested approach if you were to execute this manually:\n\n1. **Access the Website:**\n   - Open a web browser and navigate to [Asda Groceries](https://groceries.asda.com/).\n\n2. **Perform the Search:**\n   - Use the search bar at the top of the page to enter the query \"bread\" and press Enter.\n\n3. **Identify Product Listings:**\n   - Review the search results and select up to 5 relevant products, focusing on those with comprehensive information and good ratings.\n\n4. **Extract Product Details:**\n   - For each selected product, click on the product link to visit the detail page.\n   - Record comprehensive product information such as product name, price, description, reviews, and any other relevant details.\n\n5. **Compile the Data:**\n   - Structure the extracted data into a JSON format with the following structure:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"search_query\": \"bread\",\n       \"site_url\": \"https://groceries.asda.com\",\n       \"products\": [\n         {\n           \"product_name\": \"Example Bread\",\n           \"price\": \"\u00a31.00\",\n           \"description\": \"A classic white bread loaf.\",\n           \"rating\": \"4.5\",\n           \"product_url\": \"https://groceries.asda.com/product/123456\"\n         },\n         // ... up to 5 products\n       ],\n       \"summary\": {\n         \"total_products_found\": \"5\",\n         \"date_of_extraction\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\nThis manual approach should allow you to successfully extract the required product information from the Asda Groceries website."
